## About 

*I build software that makes collaboration fun and fast.* I am an engineer at
Workiva, where I work on building collaborative software that brings teams
together. Previously worked at Novetta, where I worked on video streaming and
real-time object detection. My heart is in the fullstack, where I can build cool 
end-to-end solutions that delight our customers.
